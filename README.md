# Sobolev–Ozok Lattice (SOL)

Official project page for the **Sobolev-Ozok Lattice (SOL)** — a Planck-cell coherence framework for emergent spacetime, quantum dynamics, and physical constants.

## Overview
The SOL framework models spacetime as a discrete lattice of Planck-scale cells whose coherence and resolution dynamics give rise to:
- effective spacetime curvature,
- quantum behavior,
- and the emergence of physical constants.

The goal is to derive known physical laws from first principles rooted in lattice coherence rather than postulated continua.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — public project website (GitHub Pages)
- `README.md` — project overview and paper index
- Future folders will include figures, papers, and validation data

## Papers
Manuscripts are grouped by theme:
- Foundations of the SOL framework
- Constants derivation
- Emergent General Relativity
- Astrophysical and cosmological validation

Links will be added as papers are finalized and released.

## Status
Active research project.  
This repository serves as the canonical reference page for SOL-related publications.
